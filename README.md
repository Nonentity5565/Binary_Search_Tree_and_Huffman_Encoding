# BST and Huffman
## Introduction
_Adapted from the included [report](https://github.com/PScoriae/BST_Huffman/blob/master/report.pdf)._

In teams of two, students of Data Structures and Algorithms CSC2103 in the April 2021 semester at Sunway University were tasked with a final project to demonstrate their knowledge in two of seven algorithms, namely:
- Shortest Pathfinding
- Hashing
- Binary Search Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Huffman Coding
- String Matching (except naïve)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

With the help of the Java language, Binary Search Tree (BST) and Huffman Coding were implemented. As for Integrated Development Environments (IDE), **BST** was implemented using JetBrains’ Intellij, and **Huffman Coding** was implemented using Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code due to each group member’s preferences.
