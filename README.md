# About

_Adapted from the included [report](https://github.com/PScoriae/BST_Huffman/blob/master/report.pdf)._

In teams of two, students of Data Structures and Algorithms CSC2103 in the April 2021 semester at Sunway University were tasked with a final project to demonstrate their knowledge in two of seven algorithms, namely:

- Shortest Pathfinding
- Hashing
- Binary Search Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Huffman Coding
- String Matching (except na√Øve)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

For this project, the Binary Search Tree (BST) and Huffman Coding programs were implemented in Java.

Both implementations are CLI programs and visualise the algorithms for the user's understanding.
